Hi, I'm Mohammed ðŸ‘‹.

A Lead Front-End Engineer who loves turning creative visions into tangible, high-quality code.

My specialty is building with React & TypeScript, but my experience as a Full Stack Engineer gives me a unique end-to-end perspective on application development.
I thrive on creating great user experiences and optimizing developer workflows.
I recently helped a team accelerate their development speed by 20%.

Feel free to explore my repositories!
